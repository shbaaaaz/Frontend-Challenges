## Overview

This repository serves as a platform where I consolidate various exercises and challenges related to frontend development and data structures and algorithms. It's an ongoing project where I consistently add new challenges, refine existing code, and utilize it for continuous learning.

## Folders

The repository is structured into various folders to organize different types of challenges:

- **Data Structure & Algorithms**: Contains topic wise DSA problems and their solutions.
- **Polyfills**: Contains polyfills for different JS functionalities that are asked in interviews.
- **UI Challenges**: Contains frontend-related UI challenges asked in interviews.
